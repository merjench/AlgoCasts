// Problem:
// The prediction of a particular stock for a period is given to you
// and you want to maximize the profit of that stock by buying it once and selling it once in tht period.


// Solution 1:

var array = [4, 9, 1, 10, 13, 0, 10]

// you want to find two times, ONE to buy stock and one to sell, so we maximize our profite:
// like so:  max(sellingPrice - buyingPrice)
