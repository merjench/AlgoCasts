#Extra Personal Notes:

To keep it in running mode:
Type directly in exercise file:
      #jest filename/test.js --watch
or like below
      #jest reversestring/test.js --watch


To hit debugger:

call the function manyally
cd into the actual exercise file and type:
     # node inspect index.js  
  then ... type "c"

#Data Structures:

Ways of organizing information with optimal runtime complexity for adding or removing records

JS natively implements several data structures. You will be asked about 'inferior' data structure  
   #Queue
   - adding a record and it's linier. First in first out (FIFO).
   - think about standing in line to get a ticket.
   #Array Equivalent
   - array.unshift(); => add to the queue
   - array.pop(); => remove from queue
